## Project Overview
This Job Board App has the ability to insert, update, delete and filter jobs and at the same time the user will be able to apply for a job and the data will persist using the third party API.

The architecture used on this app is MVVM and used Dagger Hilt for the dependency injection. For the API handling, I have used Retrofit, OkHttp and Coroutines to perform the API operations.

## Project Setup
The gradle plugins for com.android.application and com.android.library may vary depending on the Android Studio version. For the development, I used Electric Eel version which is 7.4.2, for Dolphin version you may set the version to 7.3.0 to be able to build the project successfully.
